# BSTMap
An in-depth project that implements BS and AVL trees, using nodes, pairs, as well as does preorder, inorder, and postorder traverals, iterative and recursive searches, finds the number of null references, and sums of levels, and does balancing for the AVL trees. It includes the typical AVL and BST functions. Uses StringBuilder and prebuilt Pair and Node classes.
